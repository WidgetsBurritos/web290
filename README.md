If you have git installed on your system, open the command line and navigate to the directory you want to
use as your base folder, then run the following command.

~$ git clone https://github.com/WidgetsBurritos/web290.git

If everything succeeded, you should see something like this:

Cloning into 'web290'...

~$ git pull
